# node-form-validate

A validation module for nodejs and express. It aims to give a convenient way to validate incoming POST data (which is the most common) and be as flexible as possible. This module is in development - feel free to contribute if you feel like it :)

## Installation
    npm install form-validation
    
 
## Setting up `form-validate` with Express
In order to use the `req.Validator` object and to access view helpers you have to register the form-validate middleware with express. 

	var express = require('express'),
                  validate = require('form-validate');
                  
    // ...Your express initialization logic...
    
    
	app.use(express.logger('dev'));
	app.use(express.bodyParser());
	app.use(express.methodOverride());
    
    // ...
	
	var validationConfig = {
    	//You can configure certain aspects of the validation module
	};
	app.use(validate(app, validationConfig));
        
	app.use(app.router);
	app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
    
    // ... Create http server

## Configuration
You can configure the behaviour of the `form-validate` module by passing options when initializing the middleware:

	var validationConfig = {
    	//You can configure certain aspects of the validation module
	};
	app.use(validate(app, validationConfig));
### Options

<table>
	<thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Options</th>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    	<tr>
        	<td>i18n</td>
        	<td>object</td>
        	<td>`form-validate` uses the [`i18n`](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) module to translate the error messages. <br>You can configure the i18n module using this option.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Express Usage Example

Using `form-validation` in an express context is pretty straight-forward:

    app.post('/register', function(res, res) {
        /*
         * You call req.Validator.validate for every field you want to validate. You
         * can chain up the validate calls if you want (like in this example).
         * You can optionally pass the field name as the 2nd parameter to
         * place another name in the error message if you want to (for example to translate 
         * fieldnames).
         */
        req.Validator.validate('displayName', i18n.t('user.displayName'), {
                /*
                 * Add as many validators as you want here. To see what 
                 * validators are supported have a look in the form-validation/lib/rules/ folder
                 */
                length: {
                    min: 2,
                    max: 16
                },
                isUnique: function(field, fieldName, value, fn){
                    /*
                     * This is a custom validation callback. You have to
                     * call fn() with an array containing the error 
                     * message for this custom validation. If the array
                     * is empty, the validation is considered a success.
                     */
                     var errors = [];
                     if(value != 'unique')
                     {
                        errors.push('this field is not unique');
                     }
                     fn(errors); 
                }
            })
            .validate('username', {
                length: {
                    min: 3,
                    max: 256
                }
            })
            .validate('password', {
                length: {
                    min: 4,
                    max: 64
                }
            });
        
        /*
         * Call the "getValidationErrors" method to start the validation
         */
        req.Validator.getValidationErrors(function(errors){
            /*
             * ... Your further rendering logic. e.g. res.render('view', { errors: errors });
             */
        });
    });    

## Getting all Errors
To get validation errors simply call the **asynchronous** `Validator.getValidationErrors(fn)` method and provide a callback which gets called when all validations have been completed. The callback gets provided with an array containing all errors which resulted from the validation process.
Example:

	app.post('/register', function(res, res) {
        
        // ... Validation logic ... 
        
        /*
         * Call the "getValidationErrors" method to start the validation
         */
        req.Validator.getValidationErrors(function(errors){
            /*
             * ... Your further rendering logic. e.g. res.render('view', { errors: errors });
             */
        });
    });    

## View Helpers
The local variable `Validator` is available in all express views. **Warning:** In order to these view helpers to work `Validator.getValidationErrors()` has got to be called before the rendering took place.

	/**
     * Returns all errors for this field as an array
     */
    Validator.getFieldValidationErrors(fieldName)

_ _
	
    /**
     * Returns true if this field has any error. You can use this to give the
     * field a certain class if an error occured
     */
    Validator.hasValidationErrors(fieldName)
